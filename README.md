# adidasTestProject
Test project for adidas code challenges

Project includes tests which can be run in such ways:

1. First, copy "driver" folder from src/main/resources to the disc C on your computer, I'm using chrome driver, it requires installed Chrome browser.
2. If you are using Intellij IDEA, import project there as gradle project and tests can be run using TestNG plugin.
3. If you want to run it from cmd, install Gradle first and run the command "gradle build".
